            /* Psychic game Pseudo code

                Objectives: 
                    Output
                        Present the challenge to the user

                        Scoreboard
                            Keep track of wins
                            Keep track of losses

                        Guess log
                            Guesses left will start at 9.

                    Input
                        Capture user input on keyboard
                            Capture keyboard input when key is pressed. Using toLowercase because I don't care about the capitalization.
                                document.onkeyup= function(event) { ... }

                            When a key is pressed
                                store what key was pressed in userKey variable. ->  var userKey= event.key.toLowercase();
                                each time the key is pressed, -1 from the guessAttempts variable.

                    Process
                        Compare user key to random computer-generated key (RNG. I am too familiar with RNG in gacha.)
                            if user key = computer generated key, add +1 to the wins variable
                            if user key != computer generated key, add +1 to the losses variable

                        Make sure all records (wins, losses, guesses left, guessAttempts) are shoved into the appropriate spans

                        Make sure that the whole game loops without refreshing when all 9 tries are gone.
